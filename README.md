# reminders-cli

A simple CLI for interacting with OS X reminders.

## Usage:

#### Show all lists

```
$ reminders show-lists
Soon
Eventually
```

#### Show reminders on a specific list

```
$ reminders show Soon
0 Write README
1 Ship reminders-cli
```

#### Complete an item on a list

```
$ reminders complete Soon 0
Completed 'Write README'
$ reminders show Soon
0 Ship reminders-cli
```

#### Undo a completed item

```
$ reminders show Soon --only-completed
0 Write README
$ reminders uncomplete Soon 0
Uncompleted 'Write README'
$ reminders show Soon
0 Write README
```

#### Edit an item on a list

```
$ reminders edit Soon 0 Some edited text
Updated reminder 'Some edited text'
$ reminders show Soon
0 Ship reminders-cli
1 Some edited text
```

#### Delete an item on a list

```
$ reminders delete Soon 0
Completed 'Write README'
$ reminders show Soon
0 Ship reminders-cli
```

#### Add a reminder to a list

```
$ reminders add Soon Contribute to open source
$ reminders add Soon Go to the grocery store --due-date "tomorrow 9am"
$ reminders add Soon Something really important --priority high
$ reminders show Soon
0: Ship reminders-cli
1: Contribute to open source
2: Go to the grocery store (in 10 hours)
3: Something really important (priority: high)
```

#### Add a repeating reminder

```
$ reminders add Soon Weekly review --due-date "monday 9am" --repeat weekly
$ reminders add Soon Pay rent --due-date "2026-09-01" --repeat monthly --repeat-until "2027-09-01"
$ reminders add Soon Water the plants --due-date "tomorrow" --repeat daily --repeat-interval 3
```

`--repeat` accepts `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, or `yearly` (EventKit reminders have no hourly
recurrence frequency, so `--repeat hourly` is rejected with an explanation rather than silently
degrading to daily). `--repeat-interval` repeats every N units instead of every 1 (e.g.
`--repeat-interval 2 --repeat weekly` for every other week) and defaults to 1. `--repeat-until`
stops the recurrence after a given date; omitting it repeats forever, matching the Reminders.app
default. Both `--repeat-interval` and `--repeat-until` require `--repeat` to also be set.

To change or remove a repeat rule on an existing reminder, use `edit`:

```
$ reminders edit Soon 0 --repeat monthly
$ reminders edit Soon 0 --clear-repeat
```

#### Show reminders due on or by a date

```
$ reminders show-all --due-date today
1: Contribute to open source (in 3 hours)
$ reminders show-all --due-date today --include-overdue
0: Ship reminders-cli (2 days ago)
1: Contribute to open source (in 3 hours)
$ reminders show-all --due-date 2025-02-16
1: Contribute to open source (in 3 hours)
$ reminders show Soon --due-date today --include-overdue
0: Ship reminders-cli (2 days ago)
1: Contribute to open source (in 3 hours)
```
